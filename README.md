revised working jq buttons in nyt sub ads

There were about a hundred versions of these ads, and they grew like topsy, each one individually tweaked and hacked. Our goal was to give them all the same standard scripts, and remove the oddball workarounds. 

Primarily this revision affected the four big square "icon" buttons, and mobile responsiveness. These two examples work properly. (I've recently come across some live NYTimes ads that do not, alas!)
